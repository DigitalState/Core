## Synopsis

1. Permissions define what can occur within a system.
2. Users are granted permissions.
3. When a user does an action, the system grants or denies access based on permissions.

## Permissions

Permissions describes very specific actions that can occur within the system. Whether it is **browsing** a list of cases, **editing** a case, or **deleting** a case, all actions are protected by permissions.

The permissions model provides a flexible way to define possible actions within a system and has two main values: **type** and **attributes**. 

### Types

Permission types describe the kind of access.

- **Entity**: This type of permission controls access to a database record.
- **Property**: This type of permission controls access to a database record column.
- **Custom**: This type of permission controls access to something generic.

### Attributes

Permission attributes describe the actions possible towards the type.

- **BROWSE**: Allows a user to browse a list of records.
- **READ**: Allows a user to view a record.
- **EDIT**: Allows a user to modify a record.
- **ADD**: Allows a user to add a record.
- **DELETE**: Allows a user to delete a record.
- **EXECUTE**: Allows a user to execute something.

For example, we could create a permissions configuration file with the following:

```
case:       { entity:   Case,        attributes: [BROWSE, READ, EDIT, ADD, DELETE] }
case_title: { property: Case.title,  attributes: [BROWSE, READ, EDIT]              }
```

The first permission definition is named `case` and defines access to the Case records. The possible attributes are `BROWSE`, `READ`, `EDIT`, `ADD` and `DELETE`. 

The second permission definition is named `case_title` and defines access to the Case records title column. The possible attributes are `BROWSE`, `READ` and `EDIT`.
