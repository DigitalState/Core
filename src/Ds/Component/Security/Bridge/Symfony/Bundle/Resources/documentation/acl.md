# ACL

The ACL library provides a flexible framework for defining permissions and granting access to protected entities and system functionality.

This section assumes you are familiar with the [Symfony framework](https://symfony.com/doc/current/index.html) (app kernel, configurations), the [ApiPlatform framework](https://api-platform.com/docs/core) (api resources and properties) and the [Doctrine ORM library](https://www.doctrine-project.org/projects/doctrine-orm/en/latest/tutorials/getting-started.html).

## Overview

In order to better understand the ACL framework, we will go through each steps required for __creating__ a new Doctrine entity, __exposing it__ as an api endpoint and fully __protecting it__ using the ACL framework.

### 1. Activate the acl library

To begin, you will need to enable the security bundle in the Symfony app kernel:

__app/AppKernel.php__

```
    // ...

    public function registerBundles()
    {
        $bundles = [
            // ...
            new Ds\Component\Security\Bridge\Symfony\Bundle\DsSecurityBundle(),
        ];

        // ...
    }

    // ...
```

Additionally, the acl library needs to be enabled in the Symfony configurations:

__app/config/config.yml__

```
// ...

ds_security:
    acl: true
```

### 2. Create a Doctrine entity and expose it as an api endpoint

For the purpose of this demo, we will be creating a directory listing of services.

Services represents government-offered services available to its citizen. For example: "Report a Pothole", "Request a Birth Certificate", etc.

In order to create such listing, we will create a new Doctrine entity named `Service` and annotate it with ApiPlatform in order to expose it as a JSON-based api endpoint at `/services`:

__src/AppBundle/Entity/Service.php__

```
<?php

namespace AppBundle\Entity;

use ApiPlatform\Core\Annotation\ApiResource;
use ApiPlatform\Core\Annotation\ApiProperty;
use Doctrine\ORM\Mapping as ORM;

/**
 * @ApiResource
 * @ORM\Entity
 */
class Service
{
    /**
     * @ApiProperty
     * @ORM\Id
     * @ORM\GeneratedValue(strategy="AUTO")
     * @ORM\Column(name="id", type="integer")
     */
    protected $id;

    /**
     * @ApiProperty
     * @ORM\Column(name="title", type="string")
     */
    protected $title;

    /**
     * @ApiProperty
     * @ORM\Column(name="description", type="string")
     */
    protected $description;
}

```

Setting aside Symfony's firewalls configurations, the `/services` endpoint is open to the public in its current state.

Sending an HTTP __GET__ request to `/services` will return a `200 OK` response with the following body:

```
[
    {
        "id": 1,
        "title": "Report a Pothole",
        "description": "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit."
    },
    {
        "id": 2,
        "title": "Request a Birth Certificate",
        "description": "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit."
    }
]
```

Sending an HTTP __POST__ request to `/services` with body:

```
{
    "title": "Report a Graffiti",
    "description": "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit."
}
```

will return a `201 CREATED` response with body:

```
{
    "id": 3,
    "title": "Report a Graffiti",
    "description": "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit."
}
```

### 3. Protect the entity with the ACL library

Protecting an entity with the ACL library is fairly straight forward. Implementing the `Secured` interface will configure the ACL guard on the entity:

__src/AppBundle/Entity/Service.php__

```
<?php

// ...

use Ds\Component\Security\Model\Type\Secured;

class Service implements Secured
{
    // ...
}

```

The ACL library is integrated with the ApiPlatform framework through it's [event system](https://api-platform.com/docs/core/events/) and will properly guard entities from read or write access based on the granted permissions.

Sending an HTTP __GET__ or __POST__ request to `/services` will now return a `403 FORBIDDEN`. This is due to the fact that no one has been granted read or write access to the Service entity.

### 4. Describe how the entity can be accessed

Prior to granting access to the Service entity to various users, the ACL library requires us to define how the entity can be accessed.

For the purpose of this demo, we will define all possible permissions on the Service entity. Simply add the following to the Symfony configurations:

__app/config/config.yml__

```
ds_security:
    acl: true
    permissions:
        service:             { entity:   AppBundle\Entity\Service,               attributes: [BROWSE, READ, EDIT, ADD, DELETE] }
        service_id:          { property: AppBundle\Entity\Service.id,            attributes: [BROWSE, READ, EDIT] }
        service_title:       { property: AppBundle\Entity\Service.title,         attributes: [BROWSE, READ, EDIT] }
        service_description: { property: AppBundle\Entity\Service.description,   attributes: [BROWSE, READ, EDIT] }

```

Here, we are creating four new permissions, named `service`, `service_id`, `service_title` and `service_description`. These names must be unique and are later used when granting access.

The permission named `service` is of type `entity`, meaning we are defining a permission that makes the `AppBundle\Entity\Service` entity eligible to be browsed, read, edited, added or deleted.

The permission named `service_id` is of type `property`, meaning we are defining a permission that makes the `id` property of the `AppBundle\Entity\Service` entity eligible to be browsed, read and edited. The same can be said respectively for each properties described.

### 5. Grant users access to the protected entity
