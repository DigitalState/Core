# ACL

The ACL library provides a flexible framework for defining permissions and granting access to protected entities and system functionality.

This section assumes you are familiar with the [Symfony framework](https://symfony.com/doc/current/index.html) (app kernel, configurations), the [ApiPlatform framework](https://api-platform.com/docs/core) (api resources and properties) and the [Doctrine ORM library](https://www.doctrine-project.org/projects/doctrine-orm/en/latest/tutorials/getting-started.html).

## Overview

In order to better understand the ACL framework, we will go through each steps required for __creating__ a new Doctrine entity, __exposing it__ as an api endpoint and fully __protecting it__ using the ACL framework.

### 1. Activate the acl library

To begin, you will need to enable the security bundle in the Symfony app kernel:

__app/AppKernel.php__

```
    // ...

    public function registerBundles()
    {
        $bundles = [
            // ...
            new Ds\Component\Security\Bridge\Symfony\Bundle\DsSecurityBundle(),
        ];

        // ...
    }

    // ...
```

Additionally, the acl library needs to be enabled in the Symfony configurations:

__app/config/config.yml__

```
// ...

ds_security:
    acl: true
```

### 2. Create a Doctrine entity and expose it as an api endpoint

For the purpose of this demo, we will be creating a directory listing of services.

Services represents government-offered services available to its citizen. For example: "Report a Pothole", "Request a Birth Certificate", etc.

In order to create such listing, we will create a new Doctrine entity named `Service` and annotate it with ApiPlatform in order to expose it as a JSON-based api endpoint at `/services`:

__src/AppBundle/Entity/Service.php__

```
<?php

namespace AppBundle\Entity;

use ApiPlatform\Core\Annotation\ApiResource;
use ApiPlatform\Core\Annotation\ApiProperty;
use Doctrine\ORM\Mapping as ORM;

/**
 * @ApiResource
 * @ORM\Entity
 */
class Service
{
    /**
     * @ApiProperty
     * @ORM\Id
     * @ORM\GeneratedValue(strategy="AUTO")
     * @ORM\Column(name="id", type="integer")
     */
    protected $id;

    /**
     * @ApiProperty
     * @ORM\Column(name="title", type="string")
     */
    protected $title;

    /**
     * @ApiProperty
     * @ORM\Column(name="description", type="string")
     */
    protected $description;
}

```

Setting aside Symfony's firewalls configurations, the `/services` endpoint is open to the public in its current state.

Sending an HTTP __GET__ request to `/services` will return a `200 OK` response with the following body:

```
[
    {
        "id": 1,
        "title": "Report a Pothole",
        "description": "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit."
    },
    {
        "id": 2,
        "title": "Request a Birth Certificate",
        "description": "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit."
    }
]
```

Sending an HTTP __POST__ request to `/services` with body:

```
{
    "title": "Report a Graffiti",
    "description": "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit."
}
```

will return a `201 CREATED` response with body:

```
{
    "id": 3,
    "title": "Report a Graffiti",
    "description": "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit."
}
```

### 3. Protect the entity with the ACL library

Protecting an entity with the ACL library is fairly straight forward. Implementing the `Secured` interface will configure the ACL guard on the entity:

__src/AppBundle/Entity/Service.php__

```
<?php

// ...

use Ds\Component\Security\Model\Type\Secured;

class Service implements Secured
{
    // ...
}

```

The ACL library is integrated with the ApiPlatform framework through it's [event system](https://api-platform.com/docs/core/events/) and will properly guard entities from read or write access based on the granted permissions.

Sending an HTTP __GET__ or __POST__ request to `/services` will now return a `403 FORBIDDEN`. This is due to the fact that no one has been granted read or write access to the `Service` entity.

### 4. Describe how the entity can be accessed

Prior to granting access to the `Service` entity to various users, the ACL library requires us to __describe how the entity can be accessed__.

For the purpose of this demo, we will define all possible permissions on the `Service` entity. Simply add the following to the Symfony configurations:

__app/config/config.yml__

```
ds_security:
    acl: true
    permissions:
        service:             { entity:   AppBundle\Entity\Service,               attributes: [BROWSE, READ, EDIT, ADD, DELETE] }
        service_id:          { property: AppBundle\Entity\Service.id,            attributes: [BROWSE, READ, EDIT] }
        service_title:       { property: AppBundle\Entity\Service.title,         attributes: [BROWSE, READ, EDIT] }
        service_description: { property: AppBundle\Entity\Service.description,   attributes: [BROWSE, READ, EDIT] }

```

Here, we are creating four new permissions, named `service`, `service_id`, `service_title` and `service_description`. These names must be unique and are later used when granting access.

The permission named `service` is of type __entity__, meaning we are defining a permission that makes the `AppBundle\Entity\Service` entity eligible to be __browsed__, __read__, __edited__, __added__ or __deleted__.

The permission named `service_id` is of type __property__, meaning we are defining a permission that makes the `id` property of the `AppBundle\Entity\Service` entity eligible to be __browsed__, __read__ or __edited__. The same can be said respectively for each other property-based permissions.

Internally, the ACL library integrates with the ApiPlatform framework and __maps permission attributes to HTTP request methods__. Essentially, the attribute:

- `BROWSE` maps to __GET__ `/services`
- `READ` maps to __GET__ `/services/{id}`
- `EDIT` maps to __PUT__ `/services/{id}`
- `ADD` maps to __POST__ `/services`
- `DELETE` maps to __DELETE__ `/services/{id}`

`BROWSE` and `READ` are both read-based attributes. However, they distinguish themselves based on whether we are reading a collection of entities versus a single entity. This becomes particularly useful in scenarios where some users are only granted browsing a collection and only on a few properties and not necessarily reading single entities or vice versa.

Also, if we wanted for example to completely disable Service entities from being deleted at the code-level, simply removing the `DELETE` attribute on the entity permission would completely block the __DELETE__ HTTP method.

You may want to consult the [full documentation on permissions](acl/permissions.md), which includes all the possible types and attributes and described in much more details.

### 5. Grant users access to the protected entity

Despite defining all the permissions above, the `Service` entity is still not accessible yet. We have only made it eligible to be accessed using a nomenclature that the ACL library understands and allows.

The next step is granting users specific permissions through what we call access cards.

An access card is essentially a collection of granted permissions saved in the database and is associated with a user or role. A user may have zero, one or multiple access cards associated to him through direct associations or via a role he belongs to.

For the purpose of this demo, we will create two access cards: one for a Staff member named Alex representing an administrator and one for an Individual named Morgan representing a citizen.

__Alex__

```
{
    "assignee": "Staff",
    "assigneeUuid": "703fb098-40df-486d-8e08-65d892b4c288", // Alex's Staff UUID
    "permissions": [
        {
            "scope": "generic",
            "key": "service",
            "attributes": ["BROWSE", "READ", "EDIT", "ADD", "DELETE"]
        },
        {
            "scope": "generic",
            "key": "service_id",
            "attributes": ["BROWSE", "READ", "EDIT"]
        },
        {
            "scope": "generic",
            "key": "service_title",
            "attributes": ["BROWSE", "READ", "EDIT"]
        },
        {
            "scope": "generic",
            "key": "service_description",
            "attributes": ["BROWSE", "READ", "EDIT"]
        }
    ]
}
```

The access card above essentially grants Alex all permissions possible on the `Service` entity. Alex may browse, read, edit, add and delete services and access all properties of the `Service` entity.

__Morgan__

```
{
    "assignee": "Individual",
    "assigneeUuid": "1106a13c-6673-401c-95df-56f2477627ab", // Morgan's Individual UUID
    "permissions": [
        {
            "scope": "generic",
            "key": "service",
            "attributes": ["BROWSE", "READ"]
        },
        {
            "scope": "generic",
            "key": "service_title",
            "attributes": ["BROWSE", "READ"]
        },
        {
            "scope": "generic",
            "key": "service_description",
            "attributes": ["BROWSE", "READ"]
        }
    ]
}
```

The access card above essentially grants Morgan only browsing and reading permissions on the `Service` entity. Also, he only has access to the `title` and `description` properties.
