# ACL

The ACL library provides a flexible framework for defining permissions and granting access to protected resources such as database records and system functionality.

## Synopsis

1. Activate the acl library.
2. Create a resource.
3. Protect your resource from public access.
4. Create definitions which describes how your protected resource can be accessed.
5. Grant users access to your protected resource.

## Framework

In order to better understand the ACL framework, we will start from scratch and go through each steps required to create fully-protected resource.

This section assumes you are familiar with the Symfony framework (app kernel, configurations), the ApiPlatform framework (api resources and properties) and the Doctrine ORM library.

### 1. Activate the acl library

To begin, you will need to enable the security bundle in the Symfony app kernel:

```
    // ...

    public function registerBundles()
    {
        $bundles = [
            // ...
            new Ds\Component\Security\Bridge\Symfony\Bundle\DsSecurityBundle(),
        ];

        // ...
    }

    // ...
```

Additionally, the acl library needs to be enabled in the Symfony configurations:

```
// ...

ds_security:
    acl: true
```

### 2. Create your resource

For the purpose of this demo, we will be creating a directory listing of services. Services represents government-offered services available to its citizen. For example: "Report a Pothole", "Request a Birth Certificate", etc.

In order to create such listing, we will create a new Doctrine entity named `Service` and annotate it with ApiPlatform to expose it as a JSON-based api endpoint at `/services`:

```
<?php

namespace AppBundle\Entity;

use ApiPlatform\Core\Annotation\ApiResource;
use ApiPlatform\Core\Annotation\ApiProperty;
use Doctrine\ORM\Mapping as ORM;

/**
 * @ApiResource
 * @ORM\Entity
 */
class Service
{
    /**
     * @ApiProperty
     * @ORM\Id
     * @ORM\GeneratedValue(strategy="AUTO")
     * @ORM\Column(name="id", type="integer")
     */
    protected $id;

    /**
     * @ApiProperty
     * @ORM\Column(name="title", type="string")
     */
    protected $title;

    /**
     * @ApiProperty
     * @ORM\Column(name="description", type="string")
     */
    protected $description;

    /**
     * @ApiProperty
     * @ORM\Column(name="notes", type="string")
     */
    protected $notes;
}

```

Setting aside Symfony's firewalls configurations, the `/services` endpoint is open to the public in its current state.

Sending an HTTP GET request to `/services` will return a `200 OK` response with the following body:

```
[
    {
        "id": 1,
        "title": "Report a Pothole",
        "description": "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit."
    },
    {
        "id": 2,
        "title": "Request a Birth Certificate",
        "description": "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit."
    }
]
```

Sending an HTTP POST request to `/services` with body:

```
{
    "title": "Report a Graffiti",
    "description": "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit."
}
```

will return a `201 CREATED` response with body:

```
{
    "id": 3,
    "title": "Report a Graffiti",
    "description": "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit."
}
```

3. Protect your resource from public access

Protecting a resource is fairly straight forward. Simply implementing the `Secured` interface will protect the resource:

```
<?php

// ...

use Ds\Component\Security\Model\Type\Secured;

class Service implements Secured
{
    // ...
}

```

Sending an HTTP GET request to `/services` will still return a `200 OK`, however, the response body will be an empty collection:

```
[]
```

Sending an HTTP POST request to `/services` with body:

```
{
    "title": "Report a Graffiti",
    "description": "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit."
}
```

will now return a `403 FORBIDDEN` response.

4. Create permission definitions which describes how your protected resources can be accessed

At this point, our services listing is secured, but absolutely no one can access it through the api. The next step is to configure the ACL framework in order to describe which entity and fields are accessible and how they can be accessed.

For the purpose of this demo, we will expose all three fields

5. Grant permissions to users
