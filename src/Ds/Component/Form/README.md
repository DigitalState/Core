# Form

The form component provides a flexible framework to handle forms, from **schema** to **validation** and **submission**.

It currently supports two strategies: [Formio forms](https://form.io/#/) and [Symfony form types](https://symfony.com/doc/current/reference/forms/types.html).

## Form

A form is essentially a json object describing its properties, layout, inputs and validations. Forms are created via supported strategies, such as the **Formio UI** or **Symfony form type classes**. However, forms are exposed through the api under a **generic structure**.

Here is a simplified form example:

```
{
    "id": "pothole-report",
    "method": "POST",
    "action": "/scenarios/e049f2b4-b249-48c2-850c-64d4c4b39527/submissions",
    "type": "formio",
    "display": "form",
    "schema": [
        {
            "type": "textfield",
            "key": "description",
            "label": "Description",
            "defaultValue": "Description of pothole here..."
        },
        {
            "type": "button",
            "key": "submit",
            "label": "Submit"
        }
    ]
}
```

## Schema

### Default Values

The form component supports [Resolvers](../Resolver). In other words, while configuring default values for form inputs, you may use **resolver paths** instead of **literal values**.

For example, imagine we want to use the **current logged in user's uuid** as a default value for a form input, you may use the resolver path `ds[identity].uuid` as the default value. Internally, the form component will resolve `ds[identity].uuid` to `294fa591-6210-4133-a7e8-d862a587792e` prior to returning the form object.

## Form Composition

The form component supports form composition.

Hidden field with property "ds_form"="formio:address" and "value"="ds[identity].persona.data" gets transformed into an extra form.
