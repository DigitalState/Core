# Tenant

The tenant component provides a multitenancy architecture framework, meaning multiple tenants may share the __same__ deployed __application__, __servers__ and __hardware__. However, it is designed to provide __data isolation__ between tenants.

It features global tenant filters, tenant data loaders, etc.
